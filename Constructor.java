Monday Group Meeting



		- Constructor overloading 
		 
		Java is a technique that enables a single class to have more than
		one constructor that varies by the list of arguments passed.
		 Each overloaded constructor is used to perform different task in the class.


		- Constructor vs method 

		A Constructor is a block of code that initializes a newly created object.
		 A Method is a collection of statements which returns a value upon its execution.
		  A Constructor can be used to initialize an object.
		   A Method consists of Java code to be executed.


		   - Constructor chaining 

		   Constructor chaining refers to the ability to call a constructor inside another constructor.
		    You can use a constructor chain either within the same class or even with another one
		     For the latter, the constructor should be through inheritance from the super class



		    ``` Wrapper Classes ``` 

		    - What is Wrapper classes ? 

		    A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types.
		     When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this 
		     field, we can store primitive data types.
		      In other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.


		      - What autoboxing and unboxing 

		      Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes.
		 	  For example, converting an int to an Integer, a double to a Double, and so on.
		      If the conversion goes the other way, this is called unboxing.


		      - Common Wrapper class methods we used 

		      Primitive Type	Wrapper Class
				byte					Byte
				boolean					Boolean
				char					Character
				double					Double
				float					Float
				int						Integer
				long					Long
				short					Short


				- What is ArrayList and how is it different from Arrays  

				Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.
				 We cannot change length of array once created in Java but ArrayList can be changed.
				 We cannot store primitives in ArrayList, it can only store objects.
				 But array can contain both primitives and objects in Java.



				 - Can collections store primitives or objects  

				 Java collections only store Objects, not primitive types; however we can store the wrapper classes
