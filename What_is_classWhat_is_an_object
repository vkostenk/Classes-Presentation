What is a class? 
a class is blueprint  of object , where the objest came from.

an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will cotain
what the object should have
the action that the object should have based on the methods.
the data we storaging in the class  we usally call FIELDS

=========================================================================
what is an object?
objec is an instance of a class.

Multiples can be created from a class. 

=========================================================================
How are objects of a class created?
 In order to created an object we need a class / objects can not exist without a class. 

 class specify what object should have 
or what actions object should do.

declaration: call the class then naming it we asosociate a variable name with an object type.

instatiation: the new keyword is a java operator that creates the object

initialization

=========================================================================
Instance variables vs local variables:
 Local variables are visible only in the method or block they are declared whereas instance variables can been seen by all methods in the class

 Local variables are declared in a method otr a block called. 

 instance variables cam be declared anywhere in the class level. 

 instances vatiariables always have defualt value. 
 Local variables must has an assigned value , otherwise compiler generates an error .

=========================================================================
Instance variables in relation with objects:

instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for each instantiated object of a class, has a separete copy. 

=========================================================================
Creating objects and accessing their fields:

as we know, a class provides the blueprint for objects.
which means you create an object from a class, 

when we create an object using the constructor already defined for the class, we have access to assign value to the respective instance variables that that constructor can handle. 

a class can be overload , which means same class might has defferent actions already defined by the overload contructors 
=========================================================================
How can we print object to show the information of the object, not the hascode?

Using the default toString() method . 

object is inheritante .

this method return a string that textually represent what the object contains . 
==========================================================================


how is this used?
 they are used to model behavior and encpsulate data 

 Class can have sppecial functions defined/ or methods.
